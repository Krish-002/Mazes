To run the code:
  at Line 924, 
  this.maze2 = new Maze(20, 20, false, false, false);
  
  the first parameter is the width of the maze and the 2nd parameter is the height,
  change it to play around with mazes of different sizes.
  
  
  Then, using this code block at Line 1089 run the code.
  
  void testBigBang(Tester t) {
    this.initData();
    this.maze2.bigBang(500, 500, 0.005);
  }
  
  adjust the tick-rate as per how you would like it. (Use a smaller tick rate with a bigger maze)
  
  
  
  How to play:
  
  After running it, a Scene with 3 options would appear:
  1) DFS
  2) BFS
  3) PLAY YOURSELF
  
  if you press DFS or BFS:
  
  the program will create a maze, by removing edges at every tick, 
  once it is created it will solve the maze (in red) and give you the shortest path (in pink).
  
  at any given point press 'r' to restart the maze
  
  
  if you press PLAY YOURSELF, wait for the maze to be created
  then, using your arrow keys move around the maze to reach the colored block
  at the bottom right corner.
  
  after you reach the block, press any of the arrow keys
  and the end scene will  be displayed with the number of your wrong moves.
  
  again, at any given point press 'r' to restart the maze.
